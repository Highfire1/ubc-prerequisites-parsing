There is no way to represent 'High-school calculus' using the available Requirement types (RequirementGroup, RequirementCourse, RequirementCreditCount, RequirementCourseCount, RequirementStanding, RequirementProgram, RequirementPermission, RequirementOther).  It requires an external definition or a more flexible 'RequirementOther' type with more metadata to specify the high school course."
