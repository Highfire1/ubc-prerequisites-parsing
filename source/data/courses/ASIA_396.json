  "blacklistReason": "The prerequisite \"ASIA 386 or higher level of Chinese language proficiency\" is ambiguous.  The type system can represent 'ASIA 386' as a course requirement, but \"higher level of Chinese language proficiency\" cannot be unambiguously represented using the provided types.  It requires additional information, such as specific course codes or credit/course count requirements to represent the 'higher level of Chinese language proficiency' portion of the prerequisite. More information about acceptable 'levels' of proficiency needs to be provided."
